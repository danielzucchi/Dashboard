# i2c

As part of the recruitment process we require the following simple task to be completed.

# Task
- Create a simple dashboard to present the data within a structure that will be legable and easly digested by end-users.
- This can include as many charts as you feel is required, plus consideration towards chart type.
- It may also include text describing the charts but please do not analyse the data, simply use Lorem Ipsum as representation.
- Style the dashboard as you see fit.

### Tech
While we want you to impliment your own design we do have a few restrictions due to our current stack:
* [ReactJS]
* [node.js]
* [express]
* [Mariadb] - MySql is fine also

So, please no Angluar, NoSQL, etc.

### Data
You will find the following files:
```
+-- data\
|   +-- weekly.csv - difference between exposed/control results per week per product.
|   +-- top.csv - top line values for each metric, value uplift and % uplift
```

The files hold the same data but obviosuly via different methods - feel free to utilise the data as you see fit.
